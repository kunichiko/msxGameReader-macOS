# msxGameReader
Msx Game Reader library 

 What does this do?
===================
 
  This is the initial job for a full replacement userland driver for ASCII MSX Game Reader usb device using libusb. You can get more info at:

  I believe that MSX needs more open hardware/open software solutions, i am against closed and expensive initiatives and the MSX users should not support this kind of closed projects these days and ask for full open projects only.
